# Week 4 (9 Oct - 16 Oct)
<p> We met again on Zoom on Monday (12 Oct) to dicuss our further plans on building upon Assignment 3 for the project.
We together would discuss the look and feel of the app, as previously we had just gone with the default look of the GUI with no styling which was not interesting to look it.
Our target audience was to be young adults who had recently moved to New Zealand so would base our design and colour choices
on more modern apps that such young people would be used to. </p>

These were some of the initially planning for redesigning the style we would do:<br>

<p>We distributed the workload with Brendon working on the functionality of the project's requested features and 
Jiayou would work on preparing and styling the different scenes for the redesign we had planned</p>
