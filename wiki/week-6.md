# Week 6 (23 Oct - 30 Oct)
<p>This was our final week working on the project. We had our final Friday meeting on 23 Oct where we discussed what we would have to further do in the project.
Together we looked at the peer feedback received from Assignment 4 and discussed what points were most important for us to work from. <br>
For this week, it was decided that Brendon work on functionality for a Leaderboard and make concurrency fixes to the speech synthesis while Jiayou would work on creating the
User manual for the application.
