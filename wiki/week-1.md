## Week 1 (21 Sep - 25 Sep)
We met up and started to create a team agreement for Assignment 3. We got our GitHub repo set up.<br>
We planned to have meetings every week on Fridays on Zoom.<br>
<p>On our first online Zoom meeting (22 Sept) we discussed design of the app we would build for Assignment 3 such as how it would look and we also distributed the workload. We decided to build the scenes together first this week with no functionality yet. Brendon would build the Alert boxes and games module grid scene, and Jiayou would build the remaining scenes such as the Starting page and Practice modules.<br>
These were some of the rough designs we would base our scenes on:</p>
