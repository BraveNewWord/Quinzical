# Week 2 (25 Sep - 2 Oct)
<p>We had a Zoom meeting on Friday (25th) to look at each other's progress and discuss what we would do further. For this week, we would work on the functionality of the app,
with Brendon focusing on the model and games module of the app, while Jiayou would work on functionality for the practice module.
