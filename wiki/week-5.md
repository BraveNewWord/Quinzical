# Week 5 (16 Oct - 23 Oct)
<p>We met again at our weekly Friday meeting (16 Oct) to discuss our progress. 
Jiayou had styled and reformatted most of the scenes built before, and was to develop his knowledge of CSS. Brendon had implemented most features requested by the clients
such as the ability to choose questions and the international section of the app. We were yet to implement the timer function at the time of the meeting so this and further changes to styling were done over the weekend before a beta version of the app was to be submitted for Assignment 4.</p>

These are some of scenes in the beta version of the project we submitted:<br>

<p>This week, we would work on any final features of the app that would be needed. We would also work on the User Manual and compile the progress notes we had made</p>
