# Week 3 (2 Oct - 9 Oct)
<p>We met on Friday (2 Oct) to again see the progress we had made. We noted that Assignment 3 code was to be submitted on 5th Oct so Brendon was to prepare this for submission. 
Together this week, we would begin to work on our presentation of the app we would give to the clients. We prepared short video clip demonstrations of the app which we 
compiled into slides and would provide live narration over which we practiced over the week. We gave this presentation on the following Friday (9 Oct).
