# Quinzical

## Intro
Quinzical is a quiz game application that allows players to learn more about New Zealand. The Quinzical quiz format is inspired by the Jeopardy! quiz game format.<br>
There are two modules: The <b>Games module</b> and the <b>Practice module</b> <br>
In both modules, users will be shown a clue that is the answer to question they must complete as an answer. <br>
This application is intended to run on a Linux VirtualBox provided in the SOFTENG206 course.

## Setup
Ensure that in the directory which you would like to start application has these two files and one categories directory provided similar to the following hierarchy:
```
.
+-- categories
|   +-- Famous People
|   +-- Fauna
|   +-- and more...
+-- quinzical.jar
+-- run.sh
```
Ensure that run.sh has permissions that allow to be executable.<br>
Open terminal in the directory with quinzical.jar and run.sh files<br>
Type in and enter:
<code>./run.sh</code><br>

## Features
<p>
To make the game accessible, there is a text-to-speech (tts) system that reads clue to the user in addition to a text version of the clue displayed.
  This was done to ensure those that have hearing or sight difficulties are still able to play the game and learn about New Zealand.
  On the starting page of the app, there is a voice slider that allows the user to increase or decrease the speed of the tts voice to cater to
  user who prefer a faster voice or those who prefer a slower voice.
